<h2 align="left">Naive RAG using Langchain + OpenAI GPT3.5 + Sentence Transformer + FAISS</h2>

###

<p align="left">This is a very naive and simple implementation of RAG architecture using the following tools -<br><br>1. LangChain<br>2. OpenAI GPT3.5<br>3. Sentence Transformer<br>4. FAISS</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Detailed Explanation</h2>

###

<p align="left">Of all the reading and studying I've done.. This is the simplest definition of RAG that I could find -<br><br>RAG = Retrieval Augmented Generation = Dense Vector Retrieval + In-context Learning<br><br>This notebook takes a very simple approach of explaining concepts that were implement along the way.<br><br>Only basic English is required to understand the nitty gritty of things and interesting links are attached wherever required to encourage one to get a grasp of the playground one has entered.<br><br>This was a good exercise and the opportunity allowed me to go through the basics all over again.<br><br>There are so many advanced topics that can be added to this implementation like -<br><br>1. including variety of sources<br>2. implementing a proper chat UI (chainlit/streamlit or iPython UI)<br>3. Adding upsert logic for vector store<br>4. Implementing different chunking strategies for different type of data<br>5. Using different vector stores<br>6. Using more than one model for inference<br>7. Adding stage for fact checking before presenting the output from model<br>8. Formatting the output in a certain way for downstream applications<br>9. Deploying it on the web for consumption<br>10. Ability to add data sources on-the-go<br>... and so on<br><br>But for now, this is in itself a complete flow of RAG architecture.</p>
